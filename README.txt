This is just a little project I started to try out qt, git, and to refresh the little C++ I know.

It's not coded very well, but it gets the job done. There are better alternatives out there.

I've tested this with qt4, but I imagine it'll work with qt5, I haven't used anything very advanced.

Compiling Instructions:

Linux:
In the folder run qmake && make

Windows + OSX:
No idea
