Pathfinder Character Creator
============================

This is just a little project I started to try out qt, git, and to refresh the little C++ I know.

It's not coded very well, but it gets the job done. There are better alternatives out there.

I've tested this with qt4, but I imagine it'll work with qt5, I haven't used anything very advanced.
